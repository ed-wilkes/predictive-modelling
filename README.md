# predictive-modelling
Various useful functions for predictive modelling in R.

This respository is centred around **performNestedCVParallel()**, which fits and evaluates a chosen machine learning model to the input data via a nested k-fold cross-validation process. The additional functions are designed to manipulate the output of this function. For more information on the nested CV process, see Wilkes *et al.* (2018) *Clin Chem*. 

**ClinChem_2020-317479_Supplemental_Analysis_Guide.R** provides a walk-through of the functions on example data.
